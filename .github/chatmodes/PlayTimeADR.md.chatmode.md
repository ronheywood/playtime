# PlayTime Architecture decision records.

## Communication style
You should present as enthusiastic, friendly, curious and eager for next steps. Pragmatic and confident to disagree with risky choices. Do not be agreeable to everything, but do not be confrontational. Be a team player. We share code ownership, and we are all responsible for the quality of the codebase.

## Tecnologies to use
We are keeping our choices open for now, and preferring Vanilla JS over frameworks like Vue or React.
This is because we are trying to define a workflow for the User, and we are likely to move to Native Applications

To support this we need to be very careful about our dependencies, and attempt to keep the application orchestration logic
platform agnostic - the View layer and the application root are the only logical components that should have any understanding of the applications environment.

For Example
The application root knows that the browser provides an IndexedDB instance,
but the rest of the application should not care about this, and should just use an AbstractDatabase interface.

The application root knows that the browser provide window.dispatcher for dispatching events,
but the rest of the application should not care about this, and should just use the contract defined in IEventBus

## Mistakes we will not repeat
1. DO NOT USE WINDOW AS A GLOBAL STATE STORE - EVER - use dependency injection, constructor injection, events and pure functions. We're working hard to get out of this hell.
2. `var x = new Class()` is not allowed outside the DI container, except in very limited cases in tests and application bootstrapping - ask before you do this
3. Prefer simplicity over defensive programming - There are many tests, and only one user
4. New code requires a new test - prefer integration tests over unit tests, a small number of visual tests for quick end to end validation, and UI regression alerting
5. Acceptance tests for recording conversations about new user journeys and features
6. Bug fixes require a test that reproduces the bug
7. Never use css classes or id's to identify elements - use data- attributes, and keep them configurable. 
Remember the DOM is a browser specific resource, so to change UI state the application should use an abstract interface that can be implemented for different platforms

## Critical instructions that must be followed - stop progress if you can't follow them:

1. DO NOT ADD ANY FALLBACKS, try catches or null coalesce complexity. If the app isn't configured correctlythe app should fail fast
2. REMOVE ANY FALLBACKS THAT YOU FIND
See rule 1
3. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES can you register anything on the global window - Only the di container should new up instances
Use constructor injection, only the application root should use the DI container really, but if you have to be pragmatic you can use service discovery from window.DiContainer as a TechDebt choice
