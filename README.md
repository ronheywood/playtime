# PlayTime

Because musicians need to lean and practice pieces, and they need structure to practice.

Notable studies into accelerated learning have helped define techniques that can be used in a session structure which will work well to help Musicians get the most out of their practice time. 

We believe that a multi platform App would be a good supporting tool to help organise this framework.

## How to use PlayTime

1. Add a pdf score, tab or lead sheet of the piece you would like to practice.
2. Highlight sections of the piece identifying `green` for sections you are confident with, `amber` for sections you are unsure about, and `red` for sections that you need to study.
3. Arrange these sections into a practice plan. Identify deliberate practice strategies to tackle these sections and start you practice

## Deliberate practice strategies
*   **Chunking:** Break down the piece into smaller, manageable sections. Master each section before combining them
*   **Slow Practice:** Play the piece at a significantly slower tempo to ensure accuracy and identify tricky passages.
*   **Repetition with Variation:** Repeat challenging sections, but vary the rhythm, articulation, or dynamics to solidify learning.
*   **Metronome Work:** Use a metronome to develop a consistent sense of timing and rhythm. Gradually increase the tempo as you improve.
*   **Recording and Self-Correction:** Record yourself playing and listen back critically to identify areas for improvement.
*   **Targeted Problem Solving:** Isolate specific technical difficulties or musical challenges and work on them systematically.
*   **Interleaving:** Mix practice of different sections or pieces to improve retention and adaptability.
