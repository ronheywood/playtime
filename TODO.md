# PlayTime TODO List

## üéâ SUCCESS: Database Integration Complete & UAT Verified!

**‚úÖ ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED**: PDF upload and rendering now works in both test and UAT environments!

**Key Insight**: Test mocks can mask implementation gaps. Our systematic approach of testing real implementations (not just mocks) successfully identified and fixed the UAT gap.

## ÔøΩ SUCCESS: Page Navigation Feature Complete!

**‚úÖ ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED**: Page navigation buttons now actually work!

**What We Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ Added `initializePageNavigation()` function to connect UI buttons to PDF viewer
- ‚úÖ **Integration test passes**: Button clicks properly trigger page changes
- ‚úÖ **Real functionality implemented**: Buttons work with proper boundary checking  
- ‚úÖ **False confidence gap eliminated**: Integration test verifies actual behavior

**Key Insight**: Integration tests catch the gaps that acceptance tests miss. Even when acceptance tests pass, the actual functionality might be missing.

## üéØ NEXT TARGET: Score Selection Feature (Score List & Selection)

**Why This Is The Most Valuable Next Feature:**

1. **Core User Workflow**: Complete the PDF management experience - users upload but can't see/select scores
2. **High User Value**: Makes the app feel complete and professional  
3. **Clear Failing Tests**: Score list display and selection tests are ready to drive implementation
4. **Foundation Feature**: Required before advanced features like highlights and practice modes

**Current Failing Tests:**
1. **Score list display** - Missing .score-item elements 
2. **Select score from list** - Missing `.current-score-title` element

**Implementation Approach:**
- Add score list UI to display uploaded PDFs from IndexedDB
- Implement score selection functionality (click to load PDF)
- Show current score title/metadata
- Connect selection to PDF viewer for seamless score switching

## üìä Current Test Status

**‚úÖ PASSING TESTS (6):**
- Upload a PDF score from my device  
- Save uploaded PDF locally in browser  
- View the pages of my selected PDF score clearly on the screen 
- Basic page navigation for multi-page scores *(false positive - buttons exist but don't work)*
- Draw a rectangle over a part of the score to define a practice section 
- Zoom in on the selected section for focused practice 

**‚ùå FAILING TESTS (5) - Ready for Implementation:**
1. **Score list display** - Missing .score-item elements 
2. **Select score from list** - Missing `.current-score-title` element
3. **Color code sections** - Missing `.highlight[data-color="green"]` element
4. **Persist highlights** - Missing `.highlight[data-color="amber"]` element
5. **Select highlighted sections** - Missing `.selected` class functionality

---

## üöÄ Implementation Priority Queue

1. **üéØ CURRENT: Fix Page Navigation** - Make prev/next buttons actually work
2. **Score Selection** - Add score list UI and selection functionality  
3. **Color Coding** - Implement highlight color assignment
4. **Highlight Persistence** - Save/load highlights to IndexedDB
5. **Section Selection** - Make highlights clickable/selectable

---

## üìù Key Lessons Learned

- **Test mocks can give false confidence** - Always verify implementation works in actual UAT environment
- **Check button existence vs functionality** - Tests should verify behavior, not just presence
- **Outside-In TDD works** - Failing tests successfully drive implementation priorities

## üéØ Next Action Items - Current Plan ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: Database abstraction supported better integration testing 

## NOTE: IndexedDBDatabase ESM Limitation

Due to Node and Jest limitations, there is currently **no way to directly test the ESM `IndexedDBDatabase.js` implementation from CommonJS-based tests** (even with dynamic import and experimental flags). Jest will not parse ESM files unless the entire test suite, helpers, and configuration are migrated to ESM and Jest is fully configured for ESM support.

**To test the real IndexedDBDatabase.js implementation, a full ESM migration is required:**
- Convert all test files and helpers to ESM (`import`/`export` syntax, `.js` extensions, no `require`).
- Update Jest config for ESM (see https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules).
- Only then can you import and test ESM modules like `IndexedDBDatabase.js`.

Until then, tests using the CommonJS factory or wrapper will NOT exercise the new ESM code.


**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Integration tests are green (file upload + PDF rendering works in tests)
- ‚úÖ Application initialization works (main.js loads and runs)
- ‚úÖ **PDF.js Implementation Complete**: Full PDF viewer with rendering, navigation, error handling
- ‚úÖ **Six acceptance tests passing**: Upload, save, view, navigate, highlight, zoom
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **4 acceptance tests skipped**: selection, color coding, persist sections, focus sections

## üìù Notes
- Following strict Outside-In TDD: failing tests drive all implementation
- Each feature should have working acceptance test before implementation
- Keep implementations minimal - just enough to make tests pass
- Refactor only when tests are green
