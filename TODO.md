# PlayTime TODO List

## üéØ Current Status: Clean Test Output + Next Implementation Targets! ÔøΩ

‚úÖ **PASSING TESTS (5):**
- Upload a PDF score from my device  
- View the pages of my selected PDF score clearly on the screen 
- Basic page navigation for multi-page scores 
- Draw a rectangle over a part of the score to define a practice section 
- Zoom in on the selected section for focused practice 

‚ùå **FAILING TESTS (6) - Clear Implementation Targets:**
1. **Save PDF locally** - Times out (need IndexedDB implementation)
2. **Score list display** - Property redefinition error (test setup issue)  
3. **Select score from list** - Missing `.current-score-title` element
4. **Color code sections** - Missing `.highlight[data-color="green"]` element
5. **Persist highlights** - Missing `.highlight[data-color="amber"]` element
6. **Select highlighted sections** - Missing `.selected` class functionality

**Next Implementation Priority:**
- **Fix test setup issue** (property redefinition error)
- **Implement IndexedDB storage** for PDF persistence
- **Add score list UI elements** (.current-score-title, etc.)

  - [ ] Delete/manage existing scores

### Phase 3: Section Highlighting
- [ ] **Drawing Interface** (scripts/highlighting.js)
  - [ ] Mouse/touch rectangle selection on PDF canvas
  - [ ] Visual feedback during selection (`.selection-overlay`)
  - [ ] Color coding system (green/amber/red)

- [ ] **Highlight Persistence**
  - [ ] Save highlights to IndexedDB with PDF reference
  - [ ] Load and display saved highlights
  - [ ] Edit/delete existing highlights

### Phase 4: Practice Features
- [ ] **Section Focus Mode**
  - [ ] Zoom/crop view to highlighted section
  - [ ] Exit focus mode back to full view
  - [ ] Section navigation (next/previous)

## üéØ Next Action Items - Current Plan ‚úÖ
**Status**: MAJOR SUCCESS! Test infrastructure fixed and first user story implemented.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Integration tests are green (file upload logic works)
- ‚úÖ Application initialization works (main.js loads and runs)
- ‚úÖ **FIRST ACCEPTANCE TEST PASSING**: "As a musician, I want to upload a PDF score from my device"
- ‚úÖ All other acceptance tests failing for CORRECT reasons (assertion errors, not runtime errors)

**Critical Fixes Made**:
1. **Bug Fix**: `updatePDFViewerStatus` was using `textContent` which destroyed canvas child element
2. **Test Setup**: Removed script tags from HTML to prevent JSDOM interference
3. **DOM Persistence**: Canvas now persists through entire file upload process

**Next Steps (Proper Outside-In TDD)**:
1. **Fix test setup issues** - Property redefinition error in score list test
2. **Implement IndexedDB storage** - Make "save locally" test pass
3. **Implement score list display** - Show uploaded PDFs in UI
4. **Continue with failing tests** - Following proper Outside-In TDD cycle

**Lesson Learned**: The test infrastructure issues were masking a real implementation bug. Now we can do proper TDD development.

## üìù Notes
- Following strict Outside-In TDD: failing tests drive all implementation
- Each feature should have working acceptance test before implementation
- Keep implementations minimal - just enough to make tests pass
- Refactor only when tests are green
