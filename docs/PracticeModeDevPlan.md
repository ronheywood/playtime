# Practice Mode Development Plan
*Generated from user feedback analysis - September 1, 2025*

## Executive Summary
This plan addresses critical usability issues in practice mode, particularly on iPad/mobile devices, and implements user-requested enhancements. The three-sprint approach prioritizes core functionality fixes before adding advanced features.

## Implementation Timeline

### Sprint 1: Core Practice Mode Experience (Priority: Critical) ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Goal**: Fix fundamental issues that break practice sessions

#### Task 1.1: Disable Highlight Creation in Practice Mode ✅ COMPLETED
- **Files**: `scripts/practice/practice-session-starter.js`, `scripts/highlighting/highlighting.js`, `scripts/highlighting/MouseSelectionHandler.js`
- **Implementation**: 
  - ✅ Added new `disable()` and `enable()` methods to `MouseSelectionHandler.js`
  - ✅ Changed `window.PlayTimeHighlighting.disableSelection()` to call the disable method on the handler rather than destroying it
  - ✅ Added `window.PlayTimeHighlighting.enableSelection()` method to proxy to MouseSelectionHandler enable methods
  - ✅ Call `window.PlayTimeHighlighting.disableSelection()` on practice session start
  - ✅ Call `window.PlayTimeHighlighting.enableSelection()` on practice session end and exit
  - ✅ Added visual indicator CSS and JavaScript to show selection is disabled
- **Testing**: ✅ Verify touch/mouse events don't create new highlights during practice, ✅ Verify highlights can be added again after practice
- **Effort**: 4 hours ✅ COMPLETED

#### Task 1.2: Fix iPad Timer Positioning ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Files**: `styles/practice-mode.css`, `scripts/practice/practice-session-timer.js`, `index.html`, test files
- **Implementation**: 
  - ✅ Added responsive CSS with touch device media queries for fixed timer positioning
  - ✅ Enhanced JavaScript with mobile device detection using multiple signals (`ontouchstart`, `maxTouchPoints`, `matchMedia`)
  - ✅ Implemented dynamic timer positioning that moves out of toolbar on mobile devices
  - ✅ Added safe area support for devices with notches using `env(safe-area-inset-top)`
  - ✅ Updated all selectors to use consistent `data-role` attributes instead of IDs
  - ✅ Added proper test environment mocks for `navigator` and `matchMedia` APIs
  - ✅ **HOTFIX**: Enhanced touch event handling with `z-index: 9999`, explicit `pointer-events: auto`, `touch-action: manipulation`, and visual touch feedback for improved iPad button responsiveness
- **Testing**: ✅ iPad Safari, iPhone Safari, Android Chrome, all unit and integration tests passing
- **Effort**: 6 hours ✅ COMPLETED

#### Task 1.3: Practice Mode Highlight Visibility ✅ COMPLETED
- **Files**: `styles/practice-mode.css`, `scripts/practice/practice-session-starter.js`
- **Implementation**:
  - ✅ Added CSS rules to hide all highlights during practice mode except current section
  - ✅ Used simpler CSS selectors for better mobile performance (removed `:not()` pseudo-class)
  - ✅ Integrated practice mode state management with layout command system
  - ✅ Added performance optimizations for iPad using `requestAnimationFrame` for DOM cleanup
  - ✅ Current section shown with reduced opacity (0.3) and dotted border for visual focus
  - ✅ Consolidated session cleanup in `endSession()` method with async DOM operations
  ```css
  #viewer-section[data-practice-mode="active"] [data-role="highlight"] {
    display: none !important;
    visibility: hidden !important;
  }
  
  #viewer-section[data-practice-mode="active"] [data-role="highlight"].current-practice-section {
    display: block !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
    opacity: 0.3;
    border-style: dotted !important;
    border-width: 2px !important;
  }
  ```
- **Performance Enhancements**: 
  - ✅ Deferred DOM cleanup using `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother iPad performance
  - ✅ Removed CSS transitions that were causing slow practice mode exit
  - ✅ Batched DOM operations to minimize reflows during cleanup
- **Testing**: ✅ Visual verification of single visible highlight with reduced opacity, ✅ All unit tests passing with performance optimizations
- **Effort**: 4 hours ✅ COMPLETED

**Sprint 1 Total**: 14 hours (All tasks ✅ COMPLETED)

### Sprint 2: Touch & Scrolling Improvements (Priority: High)

  ```javascript
  async requestWakeLock() {
    if ('wakeLock' in navigator) {
      try {
        this.wakeLock = await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen');
        // Handle visibility changes for re-acquisition
      } catch (err) {
        this._useFallbackWakeMethod(); // Graceful fallback for older devices
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
```javascript
// Add to highlighting.js
_state: {
  // ... existing state
  practiceMode: {
    active: false,
    currentHighlightId: null,
    selectionDisabled: false
  }
}
```

### CSS Strategy
```css
/* Base practice mode state */
.practice-mode-active {
  /* Container-level practice mode styles */
}

/* Hide non-active highlights */
.practice-mode-active [data-role="highlight"]:not(.current-practice-section) {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Style current highlight */
.practice-mode-active [data-role="highlight"].current-practice-section {
  opacity: 0.3;
  border-style: dotted;
  border-width: 2px;
}
```

### Mobile Detection
```javascript
const isTouchDevice = () => {
  return 'ontouchstart' in window || 
         navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0 ||
         window.matchMedia('(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)').matches;
};
```

## Testing Strategy
