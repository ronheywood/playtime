# Practice Mode Development Plan
*Generated from user feedback analysis - September 1, 2025*

## Executive Summary
This plan addresses critical usability issues in practice mode, particularly on iPad/mobile devices, and implements user-requested enhancements. The three-sprint approach prioritizes core functionality fixes before adding advanced features.

## Implementation Timeline

### Sprint 1: Core Practice Mode Experience (Priority: Critical) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Goal**: Fix fundamental issues that break practice sessions

#### Task 1.1: Disable Highlight Creation in Practice Mode ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Files**: `scripts/Practice/practice-session-starter.js`, `scripts/highlighting/highlighting.js`, `scripts/highlighting/MouseSelectionHandler.js`
- **Implementation**: 
  - ‚úÖ Added new `disable()` and `enable()` methods to `MouseSelectionHandler.js`
  - ‚úÖ Changed `window.PlayTimeHighlighting.disableSelection()` to call the disable method on the handler rather than destroying it
  - ‚úÖ Added `window.PlayTimeHighlighting.enableSelection()` method to proxy to MouseSelectionHandler enable methods
  - ‚úÖ Call `window.PlayTimeHighlighting.disableSelection()` on practice session start
  - ‚úÖ Call `window.PlayTimeHighlighting.enableSelection()` on practice session end and exit
  - ‚úÖ Added visual indicator CSS and JavaScript to show selection is disabled
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ Verify touch/mouse events don't create new highlights during practice, ‚úÖ Verify highlights can be added again after practice
- **Effort**: 4 hours ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Task 1.2: Fix iPad Timer Positioning ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- **Files**: `styles/practice-mode.css`, `scripts/Practice/practice-session-timer.js`, `index.html`, test files
- **Implementation**: 
  - ‚úÖ Added responsive CSS with touch device media queries for fixed timer positioning
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced JavaScript with mobile device detection using multiple signals (`ontouchstart`, `maxTouchPoints`, `matchMedia`)
  - ‚úÖ Implemented dynamic timer positioning that moves out of toolbar on mobile devices
  - ‚úÖ Added safe area support for devices with notches using `env(safe-area-inset-top)`
  - ‚úÖ Updated all selectors to use consistent `data-role` attributes instead of IDs
  - ‚úÖ Added proper test environment mocks for `navigator` and `matchMedia` APIs
  - ‚úÖ **HOTFIX**: Enhanced touch event handling with `z-index: 9999`, explicit `pointer-events: auto`, `touch-action: manipulation`, and visual touch feedback for improved iPad button responsiveness
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ iPad Safari, iPhone Safari, Android Chrome, all unit and integration tests passing
- **Effort**: 6 hours ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Task 1.3: Practice Mode Highlight Visibility ‚úÖ COMPLETED

  - ‚úÖ Used simpler CSS selectors for better mobile performance (removed `:not()` pseudo-class)
  - ‚úÖ Integrated practice mode state management with layout command system
  - ‚úÖ Added performance optimizations for iPad using `requestAnimationFrame` for DOM cleanup
  - ‚úÖ Current section shown with reduced opacity (0.3) and dotted border for visual focus
  - ‚úÖ Consolidated session cleanup in `endSession()` method with async DOM operations
  ```css
  #viewer-section[data-practice-mode="active"] [data-role="highlight"] {
    display: none !important;
    visibility: hidden !important;
  }
  
  #viewer-section[data-practice-mode="active"] [data-role="highlight"].current-practice-section {

    border-width: 2px !important;
  }
  ```
- **Performance Enhancements**: 
  - ‚úÖ Deferred DOM cleanup using `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother iPad performance
  - ‚úÖ Removed CSS transitions that were causing slow practice mode exit
  - ‚úÖ Batched DOM operations to minimize reflows during cleanup

  async requestWakeLock() {
    if ('wakeLock' in navigator) {
      try {
        this.wakeLock = await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen');
        // Handle visibility changes for re-acquisition
      } catch (err) {
        this._useFallbackWakeMethod(); // Graceful fallback for older devices
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Features**:
  - ‚úÖ Native Screen Wake Lock API implementation

  - ‚úÖ Clearing active confidence when highlighting is deactivated
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ Toggle button shows/hides confidence panel, prevents accidental highlighting on touch devices
- **User Validation**: ‚úÖ "my experience was much improved already" - user testing confirmed on iPad
- **Effort**: 3 hours ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Sprint 2 Total**: 25 hours

## üö® **CRITICAL DEPENDENCY: Architecture Sprint Required**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT HALT**: Sprint 3 advanced features are **BLOCKED** by critical architectural technical debt. The current codebase has reached complexity threshold where new features will be significantly slower to implement and harder to maintain.
>
> **Required Action**: Complete Architecture Refactoring Sprint before proceeding with Sprint 3.
> **Reference**: See `docs/ArchitectureRefactoringPlan.md` for detailed analysis and implementation plan.
>
> **Impact**: Without architecture refactoring, Sprint 3 features will:
> - Take 100% longer to implement due to architectural coupling  
> - Introduce more bugs due to unclear component boundaries
> - Block future development due to accumulated technical debt
> - Make testing 3x more difficult due to global dependencies

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
```javascript
// Add to highlighting.js
_state: {
  // ... existing state
  practiceMode: {
    active: false,
    currentHighlightId: null,
    selectionDisabled: false
  }
}
```

### CSS Strategy
```css
/* Base practice mode state */
.practice-mode-active {
  /* Container-level practice mode styles */
}

/* Hide non-active highlights */
.practice-mode-active [data-role="highlight"]:not(.current-practice-section) {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Style current highlight */
.practice-mode-active [data-role="highlight"].current-practice-section {
  opacity: 0.3;
  border-style: dotted;
  border-width: 2px;
}
```

### Mobile Detection
```javascript
const isTouchDevice = () => {
  return 'ontouchstart' in window || 
         navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0 ||
         window.matchMedia('(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)').matches;
};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
