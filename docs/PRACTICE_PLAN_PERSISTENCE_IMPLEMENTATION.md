# Practice Plan Persistence Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete practice plan persistence functionality with create, read, update, and delete operations. The system now supports:

- Creating new practice plans
- Editing existing practice plans 
- Automatic detection of existing plans when scores are selected
- Dynamic UI updates based on practice plan existence
- Full persistence across browser sessions

## Architecture

### Components Added/Modified

1. **PracticePlanPersistenceService** (`scripts/PracticePlanPersistenceService.js`)
   - Handles all practice plan persistence operations
   - Manages practice plan highlights (many-to-many relationship)
   - Provides methods for save, update, load, and delete operations

2. **IndexedDBDatabase** (`scripts/db/IndexedDBDatabase.js`)
   - Added practice plans store (`practicePlans`)
   - Added practice plan highlights store (`practicePlanHighlights`) 
   - Implemented CRUD operations for both stores
   - Added indexes for efficient querying by scoreId and practicePlanId

3. **PracticePlanner** (`scripts/practice-planner.js`)
   - Enhanced to support both create and edit modes
   - Added score selection listener to check for existing plans
   - Dynamic button text updates ("Setup" vs "Edit")
   - Form pre-filling for existing plans
   - Section settings restoration

### Database Schema

#### Practice Plans Table
```javascript
{
  id: number (auto-increment),
  name: string,
  focus: string,
  duration: number,
  scoreId: number,
  totalSections: number,
  estimatedTime: number,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string
}
```

#### Practice Plan Highlights Table (Many-to-Many)
```javascript
{
  id: number (auto-increment),
  practicePlanId: number,
  highlightId: number,
  sortOrder: number,
  practiceMethod: string,
  targetTime: number,
  notes: string,
  createdAt: string
}
```

### Event System

#### New Events
- `playtime:practice-plan-saved` - Fired when new practice plan is created
- `playtime:practice-plan-updated` - Fired when existing practice plan is modified

#### Event Listeners
- `playtime:score-selected` - Triggers check for existing practice plans

## User Experience Flow

### Creating New Practice Plan
1. User selects a score with no existing practice plan
2. Button displays "Setup practice plan"
3. User clicks button to open practice planner
4. User fills out session details and section settings
5. User clicks "Save practice plan"
6. Plan is saved to database
7. Button updates to "Edit practice plan"

### Editing Existing Practice Plan  
1. User selects a score with existing practice plan
2. Button displays "Edit practice plan"
3. User clicks button to open practice planner
4. Form is pre-filled with existing plan data
5. Section settings are restored from saved data
6. User modifies settings as needed
7. User clicks "Save practice plan" 
8. Existing plan is updated in database

### Multi-Score Support
- Each score can have its own practice plans
- Button text updates automatically when switching scores
- Plans are isolated by scoreId for proper data separation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependency Injection
- Practice plan persistence service is injected into practice planner
- Service is initialized in main.js with proper database connection
- Clean separation of concerns between UI and persistence logic

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for database operations
- User-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios
- Graceful degradation when persistence service unavailable

### Validation
- Required field validation before saving
- Existence checks for score ID and practice sections
- Proper error messaging for validation failures

### Testing
- Complete test suite with 34 passing tests
- Unit tests for persistence service operations
- Integration tests for practice planner UI interactions
- Visual tests for end-to-end user workflows
- Edge case handling and error scenario testing

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `scripts/PracticePlanPersistenceService.js` (new)
- `scripts/practice-planner.js` 
- `scripts/db/IndexedDBDatabase.js`
- `scripts/main.js`
- `index.html`

### Tests
- `tests/integration/practice-planner.test.js`
- `tests/visual/practice-plan-persistence.spec.ts` (new)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Multiple Plans per Score**: Support multiple practice plans per score with plan selection UI
2. **Plan Templates**: Create reusable practice plan templates
3. **Plan Sharing**: Export/import practice plans between devices
4. **Plan Analytics**: Track practice session completion and progress
5. **Plan Scheduling**: Calendar integration for practice plan scheduling

## Validation

All 316 tests pass, confirming:
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Proper integration with existing systems
- Comprehensive coverage of new features
- Robust error handling and edge cases
