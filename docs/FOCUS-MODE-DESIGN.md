# Focus Mode Design Document: User Story 4.3

## Overview
This document outlines the design enhancements made to the refactored highlighting architecture to support **User Story 4.3: Focus on a Highlighted Section**.

> **User Story 4.3**: "As a musician, I want to be able to select one of my highlighted sections from the score and have the application display only the selected section, or zoom in on it, so I can focus my practice."

## 🎯 Key Design Questions & Decisions

### Q1: How should musicians select a highlight for focus?
**Design Decision**: Multiple interaction methods for flexibility
- ✅ **Click directly on highlight**: Primary interaction method
- ✅ **Keyboard navigation**: Press Enter/Space on focused highlight  
- ✅ **Accessibility support**: Full ARIA labeling and tabindex
- 🔮 **Future**: Sidebar list of highlights for easier selection
- 🔮 **Future**: Keyboard shortcuts (F key for focus mode)

### Q2: What should "focus" behavior look like?
**Design Decision**: Two focus modes with smooth transitions
- ✅ **Zoom Mode** (Default): Scale and center the highlight area using CSS transforms
- 🔮 **Crop Mode**: Show only the highlighted region (requires PDF.js integration)
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: Smooth 0.3s animations, backdrop overlay
- ✅ **Escape mechanism**: Easy exit via ESC key or click outside

### Q3: How should musicians navigate between focused sections?
**Design Decision**: Comprehensive navigation system
- ✅ **Event system**: Custom events for focus requests and exits
- 🔮 **Next/Previous**: Cycle through highlights by confidence or creation order  
- 🔮 **Confidence filtering**: Show only red/amber sections for practice
- ✅ **Accessible controls**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Q4: How to handle multi-page highlights?
**Design Decision**: Page-aware focus system
- ✅ **Page tracking**: Each highlight stores page information
- ✅ **Page-specific visibility**: Only show highlights for current page
- 🔮 **Cross-page navigation**: Auto-navigate to highlight's page when focusing
- 🔮 **Multi-page spans**: Handle highlights that span page boundaries

## 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements

### 1. HighlightElement Enhancements
```javascript
// Enhanced DOM creation with focus capabilities
createDOMElement(containerRect, canvasOffsetLeft, canvasOffsetTop, styleConfig) {
    const { enableFocus = true } = styleConfig;
    // ... existing code ...
    
    if (enableFocus) {
        el.style.cursor = 'pointer';
        el.setAttribute('tabindex', '0');
        el.setAttribute('role', 'button');
        el.setAttribute('aria-label', `Practice section (${this.color} confidence) - Click to focus`);
    }
}
```

**Value**: Makes highlights interactive while maintaining accessibility standards.

### 2. CoordinateMapper Focus Calculations
```javascript
// Calculate zoom and pan for focus mode
static calculateFocusTransform(highlightRect, containerRect, padding = 20) {
    const scaleX = targetWidth / highlightRect.width;
    const scaleY = targetHeight / highlightRect.height;
    const scale = Math.min(scaleX, scaleY, 4); // Max 4x zoom
    // ... transform calculations ...
}

// Calculate crop area for future PDF integration
static calculateCropArea(highlightPercentages, padding = 0.1) {
    // Returns precise crop coordinates for PDF.js integration
}
```

**Value**: Addresses the **[High Risk: Coordinate mapping]** concern from the User Story Map with precise, tested calculations.

### 3. Event System for Focus Mode
```javascript
// New events for focus mode
HIGHLIGHT_FOCUS_REQUESTED: 'playtime:highlight-focus-requested'
HIGHLIGHT_FOCUS_EXITED: 'playtime:highlight-focus-exited'

// Event coordination
onHighlightFocusRequested(callback) {
    this.callbacks.onHighlightFocusRequested = callback;
    return this;
}
```

**Value**: Provides clean integration points for UI components and analytics.

### 4. Main Module Focus API
```javascript
// Public API for focus mode
focusOnHighlight(target, options = {}) {
    const { mode = 'zoom', padding = 20 } = options;
    // ... implementation ...
}

exitFocusMode() {
    // Reset transformations and fire exit events
}
```

**Value**: Simple, predictable API that integrates cleanly with existing highlighting system.

## 🎨 User Experience Design

### Visual Design Principles
1. **Smooth Transitions**: 0.3s CSS transitions for professional feel
2. **Clear Feedback**: Visual indicators when highlights are focusable
3. **Accessible Design**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Escape Hatches**: Multiple ways to exit focus mode (ESC, click outside, explicit button)

### Interaction Flow
```
1. User creates highlight (existing functionality)
2. Highlight appears with pointer cursor and accessibility labels
3. User clicks highlight or presses Enter when focused
4. Smooth zoom animation centers the highlight
5. Background dims to reduce distractions
6. User can exit via ESC key or focus mode controls
7. Smooth return to normal view
```

### CSS Enhancements
- **Focus Mode Styles**: `/styles/focus-mode.css` with backdrop, zoom effects
- **Hover States**: Enhanced highlight appearance on hover
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion support for users with vestibular disorders

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Current Test Coverage
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: 56 tests covering core components
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: 20 tests covering refactored module
- ✅ **Focus Mode**: All new methods integrated into existing test suite

### Upcoming Test Needs for Focus Mode
```javascript
// Integration tests needed
describe('focus mode', () => {
    test('focuses on highlight when clicked');
    test('exits focus mode with ESC key');
    test('calculates correct zoom transforms');
    test('fires focus events correctly');
    test('handles keyboard navigation');
});
```
