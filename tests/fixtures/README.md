# Test Fixtures

This directory contains sample files for testing the PlayTime application.

## PDF Files

The PDF files in this directory are simple test documents used for automated testing:

- `sample-score.pdf` - A basic musical score for testing PDF upload and display
- `another-score.pdf` - A second score for testing multiple file management

These are minimal PDF documents created specifically for testing purposes. In a real application, users would upload their own musical scores, sheet music, tabs, or lead sheets.

## Usage

These files are referenced in the acceptance tests to simulate user interactions with PDF uploads and management features.
